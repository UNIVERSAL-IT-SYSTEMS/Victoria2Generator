There are two dictionaries folders: CultureGroups and CultureGroups/Names.

CultureGroups files are used to generate provinces, regions, factions, and ships names.

CultureGroups/Names filesare used to generate generals and admirals names.

To create a new culture group (ie. dictionary), all you need to do is to create new .names1 and .names3 files on the CultureGroups folder. It'll help however if I explain how the names generator works.

First, a warning: the script may crash if there are too few combinations. This is because it'll attempt (and fail) to generate a unique faction name. Also, make sure there are no empty new lines on the files.

So, there are five file extensions.

- .names1 is the first syllable. This file is mandatory.
- .names2 is/are the midle syllables. This file is optional.
- .names3 is the last syllable. This file is mandatory.
- .prefix is appended to the front of the generated name. This file is optional.
- .suffix is appended to the end of the generated name. This file is optional.
- .pol is appended to each faction's common/countries file (ie. political parties). This file is optional (default = UK parties)
- .gc is a list of possible graphical cultures. This file is optional (default = Generic).

Additioanlly, .names2 files may optionally specify how many syllables will be picked from it. If ommited, the generator will assume 0 to 1. So, if you want that syllables be picked from 1 to 3 times, a .names2 file should look like this:
1
3
syl1
syl2
syl3
syl4

If you write this, the generator will pick the default of 0 to 1 syllables:
syl1
syl2
syl3
syl4

Prefix files are like this:
20
New
Old
St-

The first number is mandatory, and specifies the chance that a prefix will be added. Note that you should NOT add a space on each lines end (such as "New "), as the generator automatically adds a white space.

If you want to prevent a space character, add the character ^ (see Zulu.prefix for reference). Spaces are never added on dashes (-) and commas (,) as well.

Suffix files are like this:
20
, the Smart
, the Old
, duke of $city$
von $city$
, friend of $name$

The first number is mandatory, and specifies the chance that a suffix will be added. Again you should not add spaces, the script will automatically put them. 

There are also the keywords "$city$", which will generate a random Place name, and $name$, which generate a random name. Both will never generate names with suffix or prefix.




Now, let me explain how names are generated.

* For faction names *
- Pick one syllable from .names1
- Pick 0 to 1 syllables from .names2, if .names2 exists (or the amount specified on the file)
- Pick one syllable from .names3

That's it, pretty simple. Suffixes and prefixes are never added to faction names.

* For place names *
- Check if a Generator/CultureGroups/<Dictionary>.prefix file exists. If it does, consider addind a prefix (depending on the specified Chance).
- Do the same as Faction names.
- Check if a Generator/CultureGroups/<Dictionary>.suffix file exists. If it does, consider addind a suffix (depending on the specified Chance).

* For people names * 
- Check if Generator/CultureGroups/Names/<Dictionary>.names1 exists. If it doesn't, pick .names1 from CultureGroups/.
- Do the same for .names2 and .names3.
- Check if a Generator/CultureGroups/Names/<Dictionary>.prefix file exists. If it does, consider addind a prefix (depending on the specified Chance). If it doesn't, don't use CultureGroups/<Dictionary>.prefix, even if it exists.
- Do the same as Faction names.
- Check if a Generator/CultureGroups/Names/<Dictionary>.suffix file exists. If it does, consider addind a suffix (depending on the specified Chance). If it doesn't, don't use CultureGroups/<Dictionary>.suffix, even if it exists.

As you can see, you don't have to specify .names1-3 files for people names. I didn't for Nahuatl, for instance. In that case, the generator will pick syllables from the CultureGroups/ folder.


So, why is it important to know how the name gen works? Because it will help you in creating syntatically correct dictionaries. 

For instance, notice that every syllable on Portuguese.names2 ends with a consonant, and every syllable on Portuguese.names3 begins with a vowel. With this setup, all Portuguese names will look credible and syntatically correct for Portuguese, even if it's all invented words.

Finally, you may specify two other files: .pol and .gc.

.pol files are just a copy-paste from the political parties descriptor found on common/countries/*.txt. Open CultureGroups/Gaellic.pol to see an example.

.gc files contain a list of available graphical cultures for that culture group. You may specify either one or more options (separated by new lines). The options are the following:

Europe1GC - Looks like British
Europe2GC - Prussian
Generic - Generic
UsGC - Cowboy
SouthAmericanGC - South American
American1GC - Native American
Asian1GC - Asian
African1GC - African
