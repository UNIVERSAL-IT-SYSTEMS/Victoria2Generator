* Modified folder structure. If upgrading, delete your old Generator folder.
* Cultures:
	- Culture groups (japanese, nordic, etc.) now spawn in the same area. 
	- Cultures, not factions, now determine if a faction is Civilized or not.
	- Culture groups now determine if a province begins colonized or not (in effect, there are large chunks of colonized/non-colonized territories)
	- If a non-main culture presence is significant, it will be added as an Accepted Culture.
* Unification:
	- Added unification wars.
	- "Small" factions are now only created on unifiable territories.
* Cores:
	- Now adds cores on territories when the owner's culture is not the same as the territory.
* Graphics:
	- Added different graphical cultures (ie. unit textures and models, and portraits).
	- New uniforms textures by Jackson Pinheiro.
* Province distribution:
	- Rewritten factions distribution code (the map looks prettier now).
	- Ultramarine or otherwise separated possessions are now considered colonial, if their culture group differs from the owner.
* Random names:
	- Dictionaries are now distinct for people names and province names. See Generator/AboutNames.txt for more info.
	- Dictionaries may now have an optional .prefix and .suffix file, which randomly adds a suffix/prefix to the generated name.
	- .names2 file is now optional, and may specify how many syllables will be picked (if unspecified, will assume 0~1).
	- Revised all dictionaries, and added new ones.
* Politics:
	- Each culture group may now optionally have a political parties file (if absent, the UK one will be chosen).
* Settings.ini:
	- Added a lot of settings regarding the new features (cores giving, cultures creation and distribution, how many unifiable cultures and their size, the conditions to become an accepted culture, etc.)
* Other tweaks and optimizations.
